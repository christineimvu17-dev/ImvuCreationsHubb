The Netlify deploy errored, with the following guidance provided:

Diagnosis
- Relevant log lines: the build script ran at the repo root ([#L68](#L68)) and completed producing assets under dist (example: dist/public/index.html [#L76](#L76) and dist/index.js [#L90](#L90)), but Netlify failed because it was configured to publish client/dist which does not exist ([#L72](#L72), [#L104](#L104)). The resolved deploy config shows Netlify is running cd client && npm install && npm run build and publishing /opt/build/repo/client/dist ([#L107-L113](#L107-L113)).
- Error type and cause: configuration mismatch / missing directory. Netlify is configured to build/publish a client subfolder that is not present in the repository (or not committed). The actual build output is produced at dist (and dist/public), so the configured publish directory client/dist does not exist, causing the deploy to fail.

Solution
1) Quick verification (pick A or B depending on your repo)
- If your project really has a client folder:
  - Verify the client folder with its package.json and source files is committed to the repo (check your GitHub repository for a client/ directory and package.json inside it). If it is missing, add/commit that folder so Netlify can cd into it.
- If your project is built from the repo root (as the logs show), change Netlify's build settings to use the root build and correct publish directory.

2) Change Netlify settings (recommended)
- Update your site Build & deploy settings (Netlify UI) or netlify.toml so the build command runs at the repo root and the publish directory points to the actual build output (dist or dist/public). Based on the logs, publish should be dist/public. Example netlify.toml:

```toml
[build]
  command = "npm install && npm run build"
  publish = "dist/public"
  environment = { VITE_API_URL = "" }
```

Notes:
- Netlify automatically runs npm install before the build command, so command = "npm run build" is also acceptable.
- If you prefer to publish the entire dist (not just dist/public), set publish = "dist" instead, but confirm contents locally (run npm run build and inspect dist/).

3) If you choose to keep using client/ as configured
- Ensure the client directory exists and is committed.
- Confirm client/package.json has a build script that produces client/dist.
- Then redeploy.

4) Verify locally before redeploying
- Run the build locally: npm install && npm run build
- Confirm which folder is produced (dist or dist/public or client/dist). Use that exact path in Netlify publish settings.

After making the change, trigger a new deploy. The deploy will succeed once Netlify can find the configured publish directory.
